XR System HW3: Hands and Physics game

This homework has more game focus than hand focus Animated hands, added hand colliders and some hand interactions. The objective for this game is to escape the room by finding hints hidden around the room. Utilizes grabbing and magnifying glass from previous homework. 

Had several issues with this homework but now it is at least something. The build should work. I ran into some issues while trying to build this project on the university computer. Thankfully, I got some help from fellow students. I do not know if the unity package works. I could not run the unity package file on the university computer. It might be because the new project was missing some packages that I could not download into the empty unity project.
